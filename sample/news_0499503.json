After the actor , who is currently sporting a buzz cut for a new movie role, sat down with the kids, one boy thought his name was Prince Vaughn. \"Price Vaughn? I like that. I like where your head's at,\" he said. In addition to asking them who their favorite celebrity is (and hilariously bashing Robert Downey Jr. in the process), he also scolded them for not seeing some if his biggest movies. The kids then revealed that they're thankful for their family and friends, to which Vince responded, \"Boring, but OK.\" Watch the video above to see their hilarious chat, which includes Vince offering them some solid gambling advice.
