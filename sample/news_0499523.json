We really do,\" said Brandon Dixon, the actor who plays Aaron Burr in the musical. \"We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights, sir. But we truly hope this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. All of us.\" President-elect Donald Trump condemned the statement Saturday morning, saying the cast \"harassed\" the VP-elect.
