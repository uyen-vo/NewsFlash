The Coahuila state prosecutor's office said in a statement late Thursday that former Allende mayor Sergio Alonso Lozano was arrested on kidnapping charges. The statement tied Lozano to the events that occurred in Allende between March 18 and 20, 2011. According to a report released in October by Mexico's agency for victims, the Zetas cartel sent gunmen and local police to round up everyone who shared a certain last name in the border-region town. They were punishing someone they believed had betrayed them. It is unknown how many people disappeared, but the estimates vary from a few dozen up to several hundred. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-19T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-18T22:49:43.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
