Today in the Weekend Ka ‘Double’ Vaar episode, Salman will warn him to mend his ways and think twice before uttering a word about a woman’s character. He even tells him that he is no one to decide what a woman should wear or should not wear. For Salman, Swami Om is polluting the Indian culture instead of protecting it. . @BeingSalmanKhan has a lot to say to #OmSwami about his behavior in the @BiggBoss house! #BB10WeekendKaDoubleVaar http://t.co/RUIvJi3ON4 \n— COLORS (@ColorsTV) November 19, 2016 \nSwami Om, who always has his crocodile tears ready to get away from such confrontations, starts sobbing and in his defense, blames the housemates for provoking him.
