Written by Abantika Ghosh | New Delhi | Published:November 19, 2016 2:35 am Mamata Banerjee addresses a mass rally against demonetisation of currency notes, at Azadpur Mandi in New Delhi. PTI Photo \nWest Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday demanded that the government allow the old Rs 500 notes to be in circulation even if Rs 1000 notes are withdrawn. Before leaving for Kolkata on Friday, she said demonetisation “is the biggest calamity that has ever happened in the country”. \n“There will be no paddy crop this year because tillers are not getting paid… I have some concrete suggestions which will help restore normalcy and help all people who are suffering. The government should allow the old Rs 500 notes to remain in circulation along with the new notes. Also, notes of Rs 100/50/10 must be made easily available. Rs 1,000 notes may be withdrawn when circulation improves by December 30, or at your discretion,” she said. \nShe added: “There is no need for anymore faltu, action-less announcements. Sometimes blunders lead to more blunders.” Best of Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2016-11-19T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2016-11-18T23:40:27.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
